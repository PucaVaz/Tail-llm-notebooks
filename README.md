# TAIL LLM Projects

This repository serves as an introduction to building interesting LLM-based projects. The goal is to provide a straightforward and practical guide, with notebooks that are easy to follow. It's not overly complex, making it a good quickstart resource for anyone interested in exploring LLMs.

## Notebook Summaries

### First Assignment of the LLM Group (2024.2)
In this notebook, the objective is to explore different LLM models and compare their performance and behavior. The focus is on understanding the variations between them and identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

### Second Assignment of the LLM Group (2024.2)
This notebook focuses on comparing the performance of sequential vs asynchronous API calls. The goal is to analyze the speed differences between the two approaches in LLM-related tasks.

### Third Assignment of the LLM Group (2024.2)
The aim of this notebook is to demonstrate how providing context can significantly improve the response quality of LLMs, even when using smaller models. It highlights the importance of context in enhancing understanding and generating better outputs.

### Fourth Assignment of the LLM Group (2024.2)
This notebook involves building a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, where we retrieve information using ChromaDB. It provides a hands-on demonstration of how RAG can improve the retrieval of relevant data for LLMs.
